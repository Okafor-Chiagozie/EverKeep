Dashboard Restructure Prompts - Digital Legacy Application
1. Main Dashboard (Home) Page Prompt
Create a clean, welcoming dashboard for a digital legacy preservation app with these specifications:
Header: Welcome message with user's name and tagline "Your memories are secure and your legacy is being preserved"
Remove:

Secure Delivery progress bar and terminology completely
"Delivered Vaults" card (user would be deceased when delivery happens)
Time remaining percentage display
Any mention of vault delivery or auto-delivery status

Replace with:

Account Activity Status: Simple reminder like "Stay active to keep your account secure" with a "Check In Now" button (focus on account security rather than delivery)
Summary Cards (4 cards in a grid):

Active Vaults (vaults with content)
Empty Vaults (created but no content yet)
Trusted Contacts (total contacts)
Recent Activity (last action taken)

Quick Actions section with:

Create New Vault
Add Trusted Contact
Account Settings
View All Activity

Recent Activity feed showing last 4-5 actions taken
Use a consistent design, clean typography, and intuitive icons. Make it feel welcoming rather than morbid.

Redesign the vaults page for a digital legacy app with these improvements:
Page Header: "Your Vaults" with subtitle "Secure digital storage for your most precious memories and important information"
Vault Cards: Each vault should display:

Vault name and description
Content summary (X text entries, X media files)
Assigned contacts (show avatars/initials)
Status indicator (Active/Empty)
Single action button: "Open Vault"

Filter Options: All, Active Vaults, Empty Vaults, Recently Updated
Create Vault button prominently displayed
When "Open Vault" is clicked: Navigate to a WhatsApp-like chat interface with:

Two tabs: "Messages" and "Media"
Messages tab: Text entries displayed as chat bubbles with timestamps
Media tab: Grid view of photos, videos, documents with voice recording button
Add content options: Text message, upload file, record voice note
Vault settings: Edit vault details, manage assigned contacts

Remove the "View" and "Add" buttons from vault cards - consolidate into single "Open" action.
Use a consistent design, clean typography and modern design patterns, and intuitive icons. Make it feel welcoming
